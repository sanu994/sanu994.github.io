    <h1>LEGO Saturn V Rocket</h1>
    <p>
        The LEGO Saturn V is an impressive and highly detailed model kit that recreates the iconic rocket used in the Apollo moon missions. Standing at over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, this 1:110 scale model consists of 1,969 pieces, a number chosen to match the year of the first lunar landing.
    </p>
    <p>
        This set allows space enthusiasts and LEGO fans to build a realistic replica of the Saturn V rocket, complete with all three stages, the lunar lander, and the command and service module. It's not just a display piece; the rocket can be separated into its component stages, making it both educational and fun to assemble.
